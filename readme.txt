This is designed as to the specifications in the A4 description.
I wasn't sure what it meant by a banner upon opening of the
program so I just made a box. The input file used should be a text
file that has words separated by spaces. Works correctly with the
file given on the moodle site. Said not to include a testing file
in the A4 description so I did not include one, I hope that is
right. Hope you're having a better day than the days I spent making
this.
Also made the max key size 20 just to keep the size the program takes\
up less.
